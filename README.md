Skin cancer is a critical health threat, with over 9,500 new cases diagnosed daily in the United States. Early detection greatly improves survival rates. This study aims to develop a practical AI-assisted solution for detecting skin cancer from images of varying quality. A comparative analysis was first performed on four machine learning algorithms: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), using a diverse dataset from Kaggle. The findings reveal that the MLP Classifier, Decision Tree Regressor, and KNN Model all achieved similar accuracy levels, outperforming the Logistic Regression Model. Among them, the KNN Model demonstrated the highest accuracy. Subsequently, a web application was developed to facilitate early skin cancer detection, offering an accessible and convenient tool for users to conduct self-screenings at home.
